Description: This package is for analysing high-thoughput sequencing repertoire data. 
    It focuses on clonotype data sets pre-processd by ClonotypeR, rTCR and MiXCR. 
    Clonotype tables from different samples are merged, filtered, normalised and 
    tested for differential expression between groups of samples. 
    Diversity indices are also studied.
    Results could be visualized in different ways.
